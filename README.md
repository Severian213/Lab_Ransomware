# Lab_Ransomware
Non-propogating ransomware code using my own implementation of the RSA algorithm for encryption.
This is meant as a proof-of-concept only. There are many things that would be implemented differently in a genuine piece of ransomware.
The tkinter popup was thrown together in about 30 mins from first learning about tkinter. You must manually close the window to start the decryption process. I will work on this soon.
